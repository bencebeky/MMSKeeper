## Description

This app modifies the TYPE field of the current APN (Access Point Name) to
allow or disallow data traffic, while still being able to send and receive
multimedia messages (MMS). The desired TYPE values are customizable. Data
still needs to be enabled for MMS.

The only reason to use this app is to save on data traffic, e.g. if you have a
plan with limited data.

This app also provides a widget for easy toggle of data.

This app needs to be a system app on Android 4.0 and higher, because the
permission WRITE_APN_SETTINGS is only granted for system apps.

The easiest way to install this app is through the [F-Droid repository](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=MMSKeeper&fdid=edu.harvard.android.mmskeeper).
